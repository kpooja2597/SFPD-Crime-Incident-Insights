# SFPD-Crime-Incident-Insights

This project is focused on performing trends & pattern analysis on the dataset provided by using Tableau. 
The San Francisco Police Departmentâ€™s Incident Report Dataset was analyzed to answer several key research questions about the incident report dataset from 
different perspectives such as incident trends by date and time of occurrence, incident trends by police district, incident trends by resolution rate and the trends by online filing in the reporting system.
Data stories were crafted using the above common themes in all our visualizations to arrive at the data analysis conclusions by way of data visualizations.
